# Beautifull_RPG_modpack_1.20.1-fabric
A modpack by rombodawg combining RPG elements inspired by Dark Souls and Rethinking Voxels Shaders


How to use. 

1. Install forge standalone client

2. Create new instance using fabric and minecraft 1.20.1

3. open the folder containing this instance

4. Drag and drop all files in the github repository and override the files in the instance of minecraft created by forge

5. Go back to forge and download the two mods that were too large for me to include
     - AmbientSounds_FABRIC_v5.2.22_mc1.20.1.jar
     - WilderWild-2.1.6-Fabric+1.20.1.jar

6. Thats it your game should be fully modded now. Feel free to tweak the setting of the shaders by going into the mods-iris mod settings,
and tweaking the settings there because I have it set to max quality so unless you have a rtx 3080 or better your pc may melt when you load your world :D
